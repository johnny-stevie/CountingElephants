Interest of content - Exemplary
The content is interesting and done in a unique style by focussing on elephants and then getting to how
technology can positively benefit them

Consistency and quality of visual presentation - Good
The visuals are not particularly flashy, but they get the job done. It is however, very consistent with a grey colour used throughout

Quality of written presentation - Exemplary
The written presentation is actually very good. It explains clearly the efforts at improving elephant counting using satellite imagery and deep learning.


Validity of HTML- - Very good
The only HTML file in the repositry seems to have a few errors using a HMTL checker, however on the whole it is very good.

Evidence of collaboration including - Acceptable
Assunming that the group consisted of 3 people, only 2 people contributed to this webpage. If this was a group of 2 I will happily change from acceptable, to very good as both members of the group seemed to commit consistently and fairly evenly.

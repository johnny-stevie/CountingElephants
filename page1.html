            Deep Learning Detects Elephants in Maxar Satellite Imagery on Par with Human Accuracy

            Basic Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
                Currently the most common survey technique for elephant populations in savannah environments 
                is aerial counts from manned aircraft. However, observers on aerial surveys can get exhausted, 
                be hindered by poor visibility and otherwise succumb to bias. Additionally, 
                aerial surveys can be costly and logistically challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
                As researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, 
                University of Oxford and Machine Learning Research Group, 
                University of Bath we used Maxar’s WorldView-3 satellite imagery and deep learning 
                (TensorFlow API, Google Brain) to detect elephants from space with comparable 
                accuracy to human detection capabilities.
        </p>

            Further Information about Satellite
        </h2>
        <p>
            Maxar satellites (WorldView-3 shown above) can collect upward of 5,000 km² imagery 
            in one pass over a matter of minutes, eliminating the risk of double counting and allowing 
            for repeat surveys at short intervals. This unobtrusive technique requires no 
            ground presence so the animals are not disturbed, and human safety is not put at 
            risk during data collection. Previously inaccessible areas become accessible, 
            and cross-border areas–often crucial to conservation planning–can be surveyed 
            without the time-consuming requirement of obtaining terrestrial permits.
        </p>
        <p>
            We leveraged deep learning to process enormous amounts of WorldView-3 data 
            in a matter of hours, instead of the months it would have taken us to sort 
            it by hand. The deep learning algorithms produce consistent results that 
            are less prone to error, false negatives and false positives. 
            They also can be rectified by systematically improving models–the same cannot be said for humans.
        </p>

            What Are We Now
        </h2>
        <p>
            To develop this method, we created a customized training dataset of more than 
            1,000 elephants in South Africa and fed it into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
            The results were then compared to human performance. 
            In a MARCH 2019 BLOG POST, we described how we created the training dataset and trained the CNN.
            <br>
            We’re now proud to share the results of our work. 
            The CNN can detect elephants in satellite imagery with accuracy as high as human detection capabilities. 
            The results (known as the F2 score) of the CNN models was 0.78 in heterogeneous areas and 0.73 in 
            homogenous areas, compared with, an averaged human detection capability 
            F2 score of 0.77 in heterogeneous areas and 0.80 in homogenous areas. 
            The model could even detect elephants in places far from the training 
            data site showing the generalizability of the model. Having trained the machine only on adult elephants, 
            it was then able to identify calves.
